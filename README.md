# data-acquisition-system
This project involves designing and implementing a Data Acquisition System (DAS) on the LPC2129 microcontroller, which collects data from various sensors (temperature sensor, LDR, potentiometer) and logs it with real-time timestamps using an RTC (Real-Time Clock). The system uses ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion), SPI, and I2C.
